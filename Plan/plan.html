<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The Slammers Beach Volleyball club want to expand and promote their business through the Internet,<br>
and the goals of the Volleyball Club's website are increasing at least 50 customers and attracting young customers as much as possible. </p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site),<br>
so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
